## NetworkManager class
The `NetworkManager` class defines the interface required for managing the network system in Robot Devastation. Other classes can then define the implementation of the NetworkManager according to, for instance, the library selected for connecting to the network / server.

{% plantuml %}
interface NetworkManager {
--Startup & Halting--
bool start()
bool stop()
bool isStopped()
-- Configuration & Listeners --
bool addNetworkEventListener(RdNetworkEventListener * listener)
bool removeNetworkEventListeners()
configure()
-- Communications with server --
login()
logout()
keepAlive()
sendPlayerHit()
-- ?? --
onTargetHit(RdTarget target, RdPlayer player, RdWeapon weapon)
onRespawn(RdPlayer player)
}
{% endplantuml %}

The main methods of an `NetworkManager` are: 
* `start()`, `stop()` and `isStopped()`: control the manager startup and halting.
* `addNetworkEventListener()`: registers a `RdNetworkEventListener` that will be notified when network events are generated by the server.
* `removeNetworkEventListeners()`: unsuscribes all the registered listeners, and they will not be notified until they are registered again.
* `configure()`: configure some network parameters.
* `login()`: login in the game server.
* `logout()`: logout from the game server.
* `keepAlive()`: tells the server that you are still alive. If this signal is not sent 
* `sendPlayerhit()`: notify the server that an enemy has been hit.
