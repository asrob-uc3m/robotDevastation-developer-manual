# How to contribute
Do you want to contribute to our project? These section will show some ways in which you can contribute to the project.

## Try our game!
The most simple (and funny) way to contribute to our project is to try our game and give us some feedback. Use our [user guide]() to install our software and build a robot and start playing with some friends!

## Come to our meetings!
We have been meeting weekly in ASROB for some years now to develop Robot Devastation and discuss about the architecture and issues that arise during development.

You are very welcome to join our meetings and contribute, or just let us explain things about Robot Devastation or ASROB. Don't be afraid, 
we are very friendly people!

To know when and where the next meeting will take place, check out the [ASROB wiki page](http://asrob.uc3m.es/index.php/Main_Page).

## Contact us through Telegram!
If you are shy, we have a Telegram group we use to discuss development issues and to notify members when the meeting starts. You can join our Telegram group using [this link](https://telegram.me/joinchat/ADT1EAjJk_gwAb9GNkqcpA).
